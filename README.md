# Applied Geodata Science - Final Project Repository

This is the repository for the final project report of the course 'Applied Geodata Science (AGDS) I' at the University of Bern. 
I completed the course in the spring semester 2023. Feel free to download and play with the code. Also, take a look at the script of the course, if you're interested (you may learn some very useful stuff): https://geco-bern.github.io/agds/
